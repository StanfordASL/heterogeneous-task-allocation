# Fast Near-Optimal Heterogeneous Task Allocation via Flow Decomposition
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the FlowDec algolrothim for heterogeneous task allocation, as described in the following publication:

* Kiril Solovey, Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, Federico Rossi, Michael T. Wolf, Marco Pavone:
"Fast Near-Optimal Heterogeneous Task Allocation via Flow Decomposition". *International Conference on Robotics and Automation*, 2021. 

## Useage
Implementation of the main algorithim is found in `cpp/main.cpp`. Supplementary code for CPLEX MILP integration, input generation, and visualization is given in the `python` library.
